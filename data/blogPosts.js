        <p>When I was a child, my mum always kept telling me, "Everything has a pattern, sweetheart. You don’t see it, because you’re looking too closely." </p>
        <p>A couple of months ago, I read a book about sleep and there was a sentence that kept me awake at night. ‘Brain signals’, said the author, ‘...are chaotic.’ You cannot anticipate them. You cannot predict them. In fact, they are so random that, if you convert them into sound, which he did, you would find it impossible to dance.</p>
        <p>I couldn’t stop thinking about that because chaos and order, randomness and determinism are two main concepts that intellectually entertain me all the time.</p>
        <p>From where we are looking at the Cosmos, it seems like we are existing in a very chaotic system. However, science takes a quite deterministic position, well, at least it did prior to Quantum Mechanics. Causal Determinism implies that any state is determined by prior states. There is no true randomness in our reality, however, we are also too small to be able to make calculations to predict events. Therefore, the unpredictability of the universe was called pseudo-randomness. It’s random to us, but in reality, it’s an output determined by other preceding states, which are unknown to us.</p>
        <p>Let’s analyze ‘the die experiment’. Imagine having a die in your hand. Now close your eyes and roll the imaginary die. Without opening your eyes guess the number. What would be the probability of guessing the right number? "⅙" - you say. You’re absolutely right. However, what if I told you that the dice has some factory imperfections and one side is slightly heavier than the other ones. That information would make it easier for you to guess the result of the experiment, right?</p>
        <p>So, what do you think that has happened here? Just having some precise data about one variable of the process increased your probability of predicting the future. Cool, right?</p>
        <p>Then let’s move a little bit further and assume that we have a technology that is capable of accurately calculating all those variables, such as the viscosity of the air, the acceleration of gravity, the friction of the surface, the symmetry of the product, the angle of your hand, etc. What about now? What would be the probability of guessing the result right with all this information? Very high, right? After all, the dice didn’t just freely choose and decide which side to land on.</p>
        <p><i>“Theoretically the die throw is predictable, but the accuracy required for determining the initial position is so high that practically it approximates a random process.”</i></p>
        <p>Most of the time we talk about probabilities, not because we are dealing with fundamentally random processes. Instead, it's usually because we don't have all the information required to predict the outcome.</p>
        <p>In our experiment above, I asked you to guess the number without opening your eyes. What was your guess? Why did you choose that number? Or, it wasn’t a choice at all... it just appeared in your mind from nowhere. (?) If I ask you to think of a movie instantly, the first movie that will appear in your mind, won’t be the result of your rational thinking. Thoughts are simply appearing in our consciousness. We’re not authoring them, we cannot control them. Because this would require us to think them before we think them.</p>
        <p>Everything is an output of some other variables which themselves are an output of other variables which in their turn are also a product of some other previous variables…and so on. Everything is connected. Nothing is free.</p>
        <p>If you possessed the technology capable of precisely calculating every single influencing variable, it would be easier to predict our actions. It sounds like a science fiction movie, I know, but if you were god and you had a precise description of everything in our reality at a particular instant, or Artificial Intelligence capable of processing all the data and creating precise algorithms, then you would be able to predict the whole future.</p>
        <p>We are not in control. Our actions are not a product of free will, in fact, there is no such thing as free will. Our actions and thoughts are simply an output of different variables that are influenced by our genes, our physical development, the interactions we had with other people, events, hormones, the activity of individual neurons in our brain, etc. Where is the freedom in this? How can we be "free" as conscious creatures if everything that we consciously intend is caused by events in our brain which we are entirely unaware of?</p>
        <p>You didn’t choose your parents, your gender, the culture you grew up in, the time and place of your birth, most of your life experiences… you have no control over your genome, your hormones or the development of your brain. But,  your brain is making choices on the basis of preferences and beliefs that have been anchored into it over a lifetime. Of course, choices, efforts, intentions, and reasoning influence our behavior, however we have no prior control over our choices. In other words, we do not choose to choose what we choose. We are free to do what we desire, but where are those desires coming from? I know it sounds confusing. But it’s exciting, right?</p>
        <p>If determinism is true, the future is set. Everything that needs to happen, is going to happen. Think about the butterfly effect. Flapping its wings it already caused a typhoon in the future, which is going to happen. Being in control of our actions is just an illusion. We are not fooled by randomness. Maybe in a small picture our brain waves look random, because we’re observing just a small fraction of it. We are just like those puppets controlled by some other forces… we cannot see the controlling strings, we cannot see the pattern, because we are just... looking too closely.</p>

        <p>There is an immense curiosity growing inside me, I cannot stop. When I was a child, the questions were easier to answer. Or maybe I was just too naïve to be convinced with answers deeply rooted in our manmade fictional culture, which is considered an absolute reality… which is not.</p>
        <p>Grown-up questions are different… at least if you know which questions to ask. I’m talking about the existential ones, which have no answers. Have you ever thought about that? We are even aware of the fact that those questions will never be answered… at all. </p>
        <p>It hurts. Doesn’t it?</p>
        <p>
          Don’t you feel like floating in an unknown space without having a clue where you’re heading? It’s ok, I know. I know... I understand that it’s not fun to live like this. Why to create all this drama? We can live simple lives, have simple desires and leave quietly, as my mum recommends. But, once you have a
          love affair with chaos, there is no way back, you become chaos.
        </p>
        <p>This is not depression. This is not a shallow pessimism. This is not a bad mood. This is deep intellectual sorrow. This is an elegant melancholy. This is looking at the eyes of existential abyss and getting merged into its cosmic darkness. </p>
        <p>
          When I first started questioning existence, I was wondering where the boundaries are. Because, I knew if I go beyond that I will get lost. Getting lost is scary, unknown is biologically not the most attractive place to be for us, human beings. But with time, it changed. I got lost without even getting beyond
          the boundaries, without even leaving the village, without even seeing the lines framing our reality. Do you understand what it means? Do you know that you can get lost without even losing the maps? Because there are no real maps? Of course there aren’t! There can’t be! They gave us the fake ones! Look at your
          life, look at the people around you… and lives and things, and priorities, desires, dreams, systems, laws… everything, everything is fake. Everything is imaginary. It’s just stories they make us believe. Believe. So that we can… live? Or serve? What are we doing here?
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you believe in stories? Good for you. That’s easy. Next time, try forcing yourself to give a meaning to those stories. I try too hard. I understand quite well that there is no pain like the existential one. No monster under our bed is scarier than those nihilistic thoughts in our mind. Because once you
          lose meaning, you lose everything. You don’t feel. Feelings are beautiful. Do you know that? Of course you know. It’s exciting. It makes every molecule in your body move. But, there is other side, which is deeper, which is darker, which comes with an immense philosophical understanding of life, which is not
          just sadness. Sadness is a feeling. This is a kind of indifference, which is more painful… although there are no feelings involved… or… maybe, there are too many feelings involved creating the darkest chaos in your universe, which is inside you, which is you.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s funny, talking about pain and lost feelings at the same time. This is the real definition of suffering I guess. Maybe, the feelings are not lost at all. Maybe they are just tangled, and you don’t give a shit, because you convinced yourself that the biological explanations are the only ones to our ‘inner
          revolutions’. Fuck feelings you say, which is a hormonal game making us sacrifice ourselves for the sake of evolution anyways! But, sometimes, you want to give a shit about something, because you think that, ‘that something’ should be your priority. Do you know what my priority right now is? Nothing. Do you
          know where I want to see myself in like 30 years? Nowhere. This doesn’t mean I just sit there doing nothing and waiting to die. I try, I work too hard, I’m a curious mind… There are a lot of things in this world to learn, to discover, to experience, to create. I try to be successful, even though, success
          doesn’t mean anything to me. This is just…to put it right, like… if I can’t achieve anything at all… it’s ok.
        </p>
        <p>
          People say, this is an easy place to exist. And I agree. It’s easier to live with nihilistic mindset. But it’s painful to live with it, if the only thing you desire is to find a meaning. I cannot say I don’t care… I care. A lot. It’s just I don’t understand why I care or what I care about. There is no
          emptiness there. There is just pain. There is no just bland indifference. There is a burning curiosity, I cannot restrain. There is sadness I don’t kind of want to vanish. There is a sweet melancholy inside, I’m happy with. Yes, I can use that word. Happy. Being in pain, doesn’t mean to be unhappy. You don’t
          even know what the happiness is. So, why not to define that word for ourselves? Why to choose to fit in, when we can't? Why to destroy ourselves? Let's create our own reality… our own morality. I decided to get comfortable with this absolute meaninglessness. We are creative, we can create our own meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because, as Alain de Botton said, melancholy is not rage or bitterness or a mental illness needs to be cured. It is a noble species of sadness that arises when we are open to the fact that life is inherently difficult for everyone and that suffering and disappointment are at the heart of human experience. It
          is a tender-hearted, calm, dispassionate acknowledgement of how much pain we must inevitably all travel through.

        <p>… can we just stop?</p>
        <p>No, we can’t. We are just a bunch of lost souls, hovering on life… silently, without shadows. Do you know that shadows can’t have shadows? </p>
        <p>I know your darkness. I can see you. Darkness is the only absolute reality we can rely on. So, relax… embrace it… and maybe, try to kind of… love it (?). Can you love it? Can you love?</p>
        <p>
          I don’t need to know your whole story to understand you. You are me. I can feel you. Can’t you feel the connection? Think about it. Right now. Or… fuck thinking, feel me. I’m sitting here, writing… pausing, looking at my hands, at my visible bones… realizing how tired I am, how delusional I am, because I
          haven’t normally slept for the last couple of days, or years… I don’t remember. It’s cold outside. It’s dark outside. I’m alone…. But there are people, talking inside my mind. Or it’s just me? I guess I’m too loud… Can you hear me?
        </p>
        <p>… we have a connection. So, let me explain us to you. </p>
        <p>We are the children of chaos, because order is intimidating. We are loud, because silence is scary. Silence is humiliating… and painful. Silence makes us stop. </p>
        <p>Bad things happen when we stop. </p>
        <p>We cannot stop. No. Just keep going, make noise, find problems, create ones if there is none, and keep busy and work, learn, create, put some music on, don’t let silence visit you… don’t let it in. Just, don’t stop. You know what happens, when we stop.</p>
        <p>We see ourselves, when we stop. We lose everything again, when we see ourselves. We are back home. Safely… how ironic!</p>
        <p>
          It’s sad you know… because you really get involved in life, you actually try, you plan, you feel, you trust, you forget… and suddenly, you’re back to the start point again. Why the hell we’re always making circles? Why can’t we just lie to ourselves and be done with it? Why do we choose to hurt ourselves?
        </p>
        <p>Our complexity is a simple one. Our complexity lies on the basis of everything… or nothing. It’s without masks… without stories… without values… without meaning. It’s just there… as a nice, soft feeling of sadness and… it’s not cold. It’s not cold. </p>
        <p>Life is simple… if you don’t think too much. Why do you think too much? Does it help you to solve yourself? Does it help you to find yourself? </p>
        <p>No. It just hurts. Can you stop?</p>
        <p>
          You can. But you don’t want to. What exactly are you trying to find? The lost pieces of this puzzle? Excuse me, but which puzzle? You don’t even have a single piece of this imaginary puzzle, let alone the lost ones. There is no fucking puzzle! It’s in your mind… in our mind. We are wasting our lives to find
          pieces of something that doesn’t even exist! It’s funny! I’m actually laughing here… I’m sure you can feel it, because, we have a connection, remember? But, we have no puzzle. I’m sorry.
        </p>
        <p>So… can we stop now?</p>
        <p>You know what? At this point, it doesn’t matter. Nothing matters. </p>
        <p>This is not going with the flow. This is abandoning the water. This is leaving the race. </p>
        <p>Now you finally stop. </p>
        <p>
          Let the silence in, sweetheart. It’s the only way, to find yourself… to face your darkness. Darkness is not scary. Nothing is scary. It’s just there, waiting for you to discover it. Don’t try to understand it… this is our problem. We try to understand everything. Rationalizing your metaphysical nihilism not
          only destroys the magic of its elegant melancholy, its warm familiarity, it also puts you on that hamster wheel again. Pretending… playing… keeping busy… not sleeping…. and suffering.
        </p>
        <p>Just accept your complexity, and never, ever try to fit in. Trying to fit in will be your destruction. </p>
        <p>It’s called acceptance. Remember this word. </p>
        <p>
          Accepting without protesting… without fighting. Can you do that for yourself? It’s just what it’s, you know. We cannot understand everything, because we’re too small. We are too small. I know how it feels to desire the impossible. I know how it feels to see the limits, but deep down not to feel them. I know
          how it feels to be alone in the middle of nothingness and feel the fear in your bones. I know how it feels to get lost. I know you’re tired. You are me. That’s your reality, that’s our reality … always trying, always moving… full of emotions… and empty at the same time. I know… I know…
        </p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Everyone stopped talking. </p>
        <p>Let’s have a quiet night. Don’t be scared. Everything is ok. </p>

        <p>It’s time to wake up, sweetheart, you’re missing life.</p>
        <p>Let’s play a game. We ask questions… and when it starts to hurt, we drink. </p>
        <p>I start.</p>
        <p>Why do people think that ‘happiness’ is equal to ‘pleasure’? </p>
        <p>
          ‘Pleasure’ is a biological phenomenon. You feel good when certain hormonal processes happen in your physical body and they only serve to the goal of evolution. ‘Good feelings’ are not about being happy, it’s about survival, which helps you to stay alive and reproduce. Food helps you to survive, therefore
          eating something, especially when it’s high on calories and energy, feels good. Just think about that, what would happen to humanity, if we just eliminate the ‘orgasm detail’ from sex? …or just remove the hormones that make us attracted to the opposite sex? We would extinct. Nature has a simple method to keep
          us under control and it’s our ‘feelings’. How does it feel to be manipulated from inside? How does it feel to realize we are not that special at all?
        </p>
        <p>Drink!</p>
        <p>Let’s talk about happiness.</p>
        <p>
          ‘Happiness’, on the other hand, is a purely metaphysical concept that doesn’t even exist in the same ‘reality’. It arises from philosophical abstraction and has nothing to do with biological feelings. Correlation does not imply causation either. Don’t you agree? Ask parents who sacrificed their lives for
          their children, if they are happy or not. What do you think the answer will be? Ask soldiers who voluntarily died on the battlefield in order to protect their homelands. Ask scientists, warriors, heroes… even terrorists… who accepted death in order to reach ‘the truth’, ask them if they are happy.
        </p>
        <p>Spoiler alert: They are happy.</p>
        <p>You are happy, if you find meaning in your suffering… if you find meaning in life. </p>
        <p>
          I understand the idea of relativity. I agree that ‘meaning’ is a relative concept… and there is no such thing as ‘the absolute meaning’… But, I don’t think that ‘happiness’ is relative. We are not that different from each other. When it comes to morality, we can make some true and false claims about human
          subjectivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot find your maps in life without diving deep into darkness… without getting lost… without staring into the demonic eyes of the Unknown, ready to die… to lose… to risk. ‘Acceptance’ is a powerful attitude, but it will hurt. Life is suffering. Tragedies happen… people die, god is dead, nature doesn’t
          care about you… emptiness is the essence of the whole existence. What a life! Huh?
        </p>
        <p>Drink.</p>
        <p>Don’t be sad, you’re not alone. I feel you… we have a connection. I’m here. </p>
        <p>It’s time to wake up, sweetheart. I need you to do something crazy.</p>
        <p>
          This is the first day of the rest of your life. Do something uncomfortable… something risky. Do something that you have been avoiding for a long time. Get the hell out of your comfort zone! Do you want to change something? Change it now! Do you want to achieve something? Go for it. Do you need to cry? I’m
          here. No need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bear witness that a man has the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.
        </p>
        <p>‘Pick up your damn suffering, and bear it, and try to be a good person so you don't make it worse.’ — said Jordan Peterson.</p>
        <p>I promise you, it’s not that scary, there is nothing for you to lose… well, maybe some good feelings, but, you know what?</p>
        <p>Fuck feelings.</p>
        <p>They won’t help us to grow. They are not good for us in the long run. Don’t try to stop them either. You cannot stop feeling scared. But you can change how you react to those feelings. Observe them. Accept them. Ignore them.</p>
        <p>Are you satisfied with your short term pleasures and fake safety? </p>
        <p>How pathetic! Are you that mediocre? Are you that weak? </p>
        <p>
          No. Don’t let the comforts of modern life mislead you. You’re tougher than you think. We are capable of facing hell and still survive. We have the magic inside, which feeds on our pain and becomes stronger. Life happens to us and we accept… we adapt. Trust me, we can adapt to anything… The problem with
          ‘sensitive people’ is that they’ve never been in any situation that would turn them into the monsters they’re capable of being.
        </p>
        <p>Unleash your monsters. </p>
        <p>Do something crazy… something scary. Don’t think about other people… nobody matters, nothing matters. Do something for your life, that you want to do. I guarantee you, it will hurt… but it will make you happy. </p>
        <p>‘Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'’ — said Nietzsche. </p>
        <p>
          It’s your job to find that ‘why’. You cannot find it by simply avoiding the uncomfortable… by rejecting the reality, by hiding behind your biological emotions, or playing the victim. Take responsibility for your own life. Stop the excuses. You’re living your own masterpiece, only yours. You are in control of
          your decisions, no matter what happens. Conjure your own world, not only metaphorically but also literally and neurologically.
        </p>
        <p>“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” — said Viktor Frankl.</p>
        <p>There is nothing for you to lose. Wake up! You are dying.</p>

        <p>
          I’m not going to tell you to dedicate yourself to finding the answer. Don’t waste your life looking for something that doesn’t exist. You can try. You can deny every doubt in your mind and keep pushing yourself into a mediocre lifestyle, just because you’re afraid of facing yourself. Just because you’re
          afraid of living a meaningless life. But, why to choose to add more suffering to life, as if there were less? Living to find a meaning is not meaningful at all.
        </p>
        <p>Viktor Frankl believed that humans are motivated by something called a ‘will to meaning’, which is the desire to find meaning in life. He argued that life can have meaning even in the most miserable of circumstances, and that the motivation for living comes from finding that meaning. </p>
        <p>
          In other words, if you’re looking for THE meaning, you won’t find it. But if you’re looking for A meaning. It’s possible to find one and stick to it. Do you think all those people around you have a clue about what the hell they are doing in life? No! The majority just live on autopilot… not questioning
          existence, repeating what others do, following some stupid norms and rules, not overthinking about it and hoping for the best. They think if they live mediocre lives, if they complete all the vain steps of society, if they are normal, if they fit… when they die, some angel will appear and tell them
          ‘congratulations you lived a meaningful life’.
        </p>
        <p>
          No. Nobody will tell you if your life is, or was, meaningful or not. But you will know it. You will feel it. How?! How is it even possible to feel it? What’s this thing inside of us, constantly whispering about good and bad, and shaming us, and cheering us, and making us to feel guilty or be proud of
          ourselves? I call it our inner Roskolnikov. Others call it morality, which is the only thing that will keep you sane in this abstract reality.
        </p>
        <p>Don’t lose it. </p>
        <p>Not losing your morality, when there's nothing left... is your elegancy. Not because they deserve it. Just because you're the Übermensch. Just because you deserve it. Not because you're a narcissist. But, because you have the control.</p>
        <p>This is the same ‘control’ which kept Viktor Frankl alive in hell. This is the same control which helped Albert Camus to fight his nihilistic monsters. This is the same control which gifted freedom to Jean-Paul Sartre in a desert of meaninglessness. </p>
        <p>
          Don’t turn to god or nature to find some morality either. God has no morality. Nature on the other hand… doesn’t give a shit about you. No. Nature doesn’t have any morality either. I mean… at least ‘morality’ in a sense of word, which is rooted in our consciousness, which has some biological explanations,
          keeping all those philosophers and psychologists occupied during centuries. I don’t want to touch its biological explanations, because when it comes to biological reality, it becomes very hard for me to concentrate on to the idea of meaning.
        </p>
        <p>Anyway…</p>
        <p>
          It’s very interesting that morality is the quality lacking in God and Nature, but present to us in experience. When it comes to encountering with the universe – its indifference toward us, its apparent lack of purpose, and the suffering and death in it – leads us to the conclusion that we are in an absurd and
          miserable situation, and ending our ride can seem appealing. Yet this needn’t be an invitation to suicide. In such a situation, we can still lead a meaningful and moral life; in other words… add some music to your ride.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life is suffering. God is dead. Cosmos doesn’t care. Nature is not ultimately holistic and purposeful in any meaningful sense. However there is still a possibility for you to make a meaningful life and meet suffering with a compassionate imagination. Since nobody else—and nothing else—will value you, value
          yourself. If God and Nature will not speak, you speak. If no one is listening, you listen. You question. You choose. You create value. You find your meaning.
        </p>
        <p>However. </p>
        <p>
          Remember. You already asked the question. ‘What’s point?’ So… Make some place in your soul for cold nihilism, which will never leave you. There is no cure for it. Be ready to live with a huge emptiness inside. Nothing will totally fill it. But you can accept it. Only acceptance will make you free. Only
          freedom will help you to keep your morality. Only morality will keep you sane.</p>
        <p>It’s ok to be lost. It’s ok to be awkward. It’s ok to be sad… it’s ok to feel empty. </p>
        <p>That’s your reality.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Recently, I’ve migrated my personal portfolio, this webpage, from React into Next.js and by ‘migrated’ I mean, I’ve built it again using Next.js, because I decided to optimize the logic of my code and data structure in order to make it easier to read and understand. Also, I wanted to make it more beautiful, because, hey, I’m more designer than a developer. :)</p>
        <p>Anyway, as my new webpage is online now, I decided to share the reasons why I made this change and said ‘goodbye’ to React. Just kidding, this is not a sad story.</p>

        <img src='/BlogPosts/Professional/Blog1-Migration/2.jpg' {syntaxcorrection}={increaseCount}/>

        <p>At first, a little bit about my React background: I started coding in React about a year ago and I immediately fell in love with it. It was originally created by Facebook and has become one of the most popular libraries in the frontend world today. It is easily extendable and can include features like routing as well as state management patterns with libraries like Redux etc. Plus, hooks like useState, useEffect and useContext? Oh my 001001011, It felt like coding in Heaven, using magical functions from the Garden of Eden and making api calls to the Highest Glory…  Building single page applications with React was really fun.</p>
        <p>Then I met with Next.js, which was developed by Vercel (formerly Zeit) and created on top of React in an effort to build an easy-to-use development framework. It uses many of the popular features of React and, right out of the box, provides things like pre-rendering, routing, code splitting, webpack support and much more. When I first started coding in Next.js, everything felt like the same… But, was it?</p>
        <p>The answer is: kind of. Let’s talk about the differences between them.</p>
        <h1>The major distinction, which was also very important for me was Client Side Rendering and Server Side Rendering, shortly CSR and SSR.</h1>
        <p>The regular React app does something called Client Side Routing and what this means is when you make a request to this website, basically all of the logic for that site gets shipped down in javascript with a single blank HTML page and then everything is rendered on the client side. So any API call that you can make, is made from the frontend, because basically all of the application is sent down at the initial request.</p>

        <p>Next.js, on the other hand, gives you the flexibility to choose between CSR and SSR (or a mix of both!) on a per page basis. This is actually the traditional way of building web pages. So, basically you make a request to a server, then the server interacts with the database, fetches all the information needed and sends that page back to you. This would happen with every request for a different page that you would need. 
        </p>
        <h1>Now you can ask, ‘Which are the benefits of SSR for you, Sura?’</h1>
        <p>I’d not even let you finish your question and immediately say: ‘SSR means better SEO practises!’</p>

        <img src='/BlogPosts/Professional/Blog1-Migration/3.jpg' {syntaxcorrection}={increaseCount}/>

        <p>SEO is essential for making your webpage easier for Google to understand. Basically, before indexing the page, Google has to go in and run all of the javascript, in order to understand what’s going on the page. With SSR, by the time you get to the page,  the search engine has already all of the information needed, in order to gauge SEO of that page. Better SEO means better performance, which means more visitors to the webpage! Yay!</p>
        <p>With Next.js, I was able to write my code in React - the technology I love. And the visitor on my site gets a plain HTML document (with visible content, and a little rehydrated JS), which gets a massive performance boost. Plus, Google loves me now!</p>
        <p>Besides the mentioned advantage, Next.js has other cool features like built-in static and dynamic routing, stable incremental static regeneration, webpack 5 support, persistent caching for page bundles, out of the box support for Sass Modules and Typescript, all sorts of performance optimizations, amazing deployment processes and community and much more.</p>
        <p>Shortly, Next.js abstracted away all those performance and development setups I needed with a typical React app and allowed me to focus on what matters - my business logic code and data structure. So, I’m really convinced that Next.js is the future of React.</p>
